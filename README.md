## Description:

Simple script that merges all .pdf files in the /input folder, then outputs them to the /output folder.

## Features:

If your project has multiple features, list them here. Don’t be afraid to brag if your project has unique features that make it stand out. You can even add screenshots and gifs to show off the features.

## Requirements:

1. Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## How to Use:

1. Place all your .pdf files in the _input_ directory.

3. Name the output file.
   - Leave off the _.pdf_ extension.
   - Leave blank to default to _\_merged.pdf_.
4. Press _Enter_.
5. Choose 'y' or 'n' if you'd like to delete the contents of the input folder
   - Note: **THIS IS PERMANENT**
6. Retrieve your merged file from the _output_ directory.
